This project contains the depot application as described in the Agile Development with Rails book from the
[Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition).

Departures from the book:

1. All model objects use a UUID as their primary key, rather than the standard Rails autogenerated numeric key.

2. Uses [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for HTML & CSS generation.

3. The user, product and store controllers have been modified to use the [POST-REDIRECT-GET][PRG]
   web application design pattern as an exercise to see what it takes to make active-resource controllers
   (and other rails controllers) behave nicely with browsers' back & refresh buttons.

4. Uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) and [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) for testing.
